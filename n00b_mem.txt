run the http-server FIRST with "node server.js"

then (if you wanna see the changes appear instant while developing) run "gulp serve"

if you wanna make sure to install all software (with "npm install" (nodejs not included)) 
when migrating to a new host, run "npm install rpi-gpio --save". To make sure it worked, open
"package.json" and find rpi-gpio, or whatever package
